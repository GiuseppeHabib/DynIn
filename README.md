# DynIn
Code for the estimation of the local integrity measure (LIM) of dynamical systems.

DynIn is a Matlab toolbox which enables to compute the LIM of a steady state solution (equilibrium or periodic solution) of a dynamical system. 
The LIM is a particular type of dynamical integrity measure, which aims at providing a quantitative value about the robustness of a stable steady state against external perturbation. This is usually obtrained by computing the basisn of attraction of the system; however, this is a very lengthy procedure. This algorithm is able to compute the task much rapidly, which is its main advantage.

Various examples are provided for utilizing the code.

Please read the tutorial file for extended explanation of what the code can be used for, how to install it, limitations and so on.

Extensive disucssion and contestualization of the algorithm with respect to the current scientific literature is available in this paper
